A JavaScript implementation of the HTL Specification (Formerly Sightly). The purpose is to use this to make a better 
UI development experience for AEM developers without the need for a full-blown AEM instance and maven build process.

## I'M NOT READY YET!

* Render elements based on `data-sly-test` evaluations
* Evaluate expressions against JS objects

## In progress
